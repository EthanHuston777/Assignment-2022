							Copyright is a legal term which will protect a creator of almost all types from people stealing their creation. 
							There is a wide range of materials  under this law for example, books, music, journals, photographs and many more. 
							Copyright is something that remains in place for several years, usually 95 years from publication or 120 years for the creation of work, 
							and is automatically applied to works, even if the creator doesn’t do it themselves.

							<ul>
								<li>The first creative licencing is Attribute or BY. This symbol indicates you must attribute the source of work by siting the source.</li>
								<li>The second creative licencing is called Share Alike or SA. This indicates that any work that you create using a work with this symbol must have the same creative licencing.</li>
								<li>The third creative licencing means No Derivatives or ND. This indicates that the work its associated with cannot be changed when used but must stay the same.</li>
								<li>The final creative licencing is Non-Commercial or NC. This indicates that any work using content with this symbol cannot be used to make money.</li>
							</ul>
							Fair use", or in NZ "fair dealing" is a way around copyright without asking for permission. This is the case when only a small amount is being copied or if the usage is research, private study, criticism or review or reporting current events.

							A privacy policy is a statement or document which declares how the user's/client's privacy will be maintained when they are using a service/product. 
							It will explain to the user/client the actions that will be taken to ensure that no data/information is leaked, and what will happen if it is. 
							It will also inform the user/client what their role and ability is in alignment with any of their information is. The privacy policy will also explain the use of the information/data they are handing over.
							<br><br>
							In New Zealand the privacy policy will need to align with the 2020 privacy act and follow each principle down to the T. To read the privacy principles please read here <a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/privacy-principles/">Privacy Principles 2020</a>

							<li>Meta data – Putting keywords into your meta data (meta title and description) of a website will make it able to be matched easier through the search engine.</li>	
							<li>Backlinks – This is to produce links from other websites back to your website so people may find it through a similar topic or accidentally find themselves there.</li>

							<li>Server Reliability – An important factor is how reliable the server hosting the website is, if it has poor reliability or if the service providers are unreliable then your money is not being well spent considering you’re not always getting the service.</li>
							<li>Account Limitations – Different hosting companies will allow a certain number of webpages and the number of scripts that are to be processed. This will determine how much you’ll be getting out of your website. This will need to be taken into higher consideration if your website is quite large or detailed.</li>
							<li>Price – How much the service will cost, through this alongside the above factors, you can determine if the website hosting service is worthwhile.</li>

							<li>Choose a performance-optimized hosting solution (a hosting solution that runs quickly even on the fall of price.)</li>
							<li>Don’t scale down images - Resize the images with a software and implement into the website as a new image.</li>
							<li>Place JavaScript and CSS in external files - Keep them separate so they are loaded once when the website is opened for the first time and kept loaded, also allows for easier maintenance.</li>	
							<li>Cache your web pages - statically cache wen pages to decrease strain on server as well as speed up page rendering times.</li>

						<h2 class="h2-flip-box-research">5 Important Actions To Carry Out When Maintaining A Website</h2>

							<li>Follow Tech Trends - Use the latest tech and code to have the best looking and feeling website possible.</li>
							<li>Run A Content Audit - To consistently produce high-performing content, keep track of content metrics and review your content.</li>	
							<li>Review Website Performance - Watch amount of people entering website over time, update to keep as many as possible.</li>

						<ol id="smaller-left-text">
							<li>Backdoor Trojan - An attack where the attacker makes their way through a back door and gains remote control of a victim's system.</li>
							<li>Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack - Attacker will frequently use JS for this attack, they will add malicious code to a proper website or app and use it to extract a user's information.</li>	
							<li>Denial-of-service (DoS) - Overwhelming a system by flooding it, this attack is to break down the defences for another attack as the systems will be unable to respond or fight back.</li>
							<li>4.	DNS tunnelling - Cybercriminals use DNS tunnelling to exchange application data, they will setup false servers or attacked servers and make intact servers request data from them, silently and slowly giving the good servers malware or similar.</li>	
							<li>Malware - Malware is malicious software that can render infected systems inoperable. Most malware variants destroy data by deleting or wiping files critical to the operating system's ability to run.</li>
						</ol>
						<p id="smaller-left-text">
						To protect against cyberattacks of any kind, including these, do the following. 
						Create secure passwords and different passwords for different areas and application, you don't want the hacker to get everything.
						Have strong firewalls and similar systems in place to keep low level attacks at bay. Scan networks for anything suspicious and remove it immediately. 
						Track suspicious DNS traffic by following dodgy or unheard-of names. Have deep scans always running and get some better protection than the default. 
						Backup all drives into an impenetrable server that is isolated from the rest in case of an emergency. 
						For all the above attacks, have a fail safe for them, like for a DDOS/DOS attack, have a system in place to catch items and lower the chances of being flooded.
